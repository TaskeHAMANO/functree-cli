## Description
functree-cli is a command-line tool, which allows user to visualize, customize, and compute statistical test to understand the biological functionality of their omics data.

functree-cli allows user to map their omics data on to a pre-defined treemap, which is based on the [KEGG BRITE](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/brite.html) or [EnteroPathway](http://www.enteropathway.org/) database.

This allows user to quickly and comprehensively understand the functional potential of their data, and to develop further hypothesis and scientific insights.
